# Create-Thumbnails

This workflow generates thumbnails for the topo50 and topo250 GeoTiffs and TIFF.
The thumbnails are used on the LINZ website at the [Topo50](https://www.linz.govt.nz/products-services/maps/new-zealand-topographic-maps/topo50-map-chooser) and [Topo250](https://www.linz.govt.nz/products-services/maps/new-zealand-topographic-maps/topo250-map-chooser) Map Chooser Pages.

Thumbnailing uses two gdal_translate steps.
Upon completion all standardised TIFF and STAC files will be located within the `./intermediate/` directory of the workflow in the artifacts bucket. From here the thumbnails can be moved to `s3://linz-topographic` using the publish-copy workflow.

## Workflow Outputs

The output thumbnails will be located within the `./intermediate/` directory of the workflow in the artifacts bucket.

## Workflow Description

```mermaid
graph TD;
    aws-list-->create-thumbnails;
    get-location-->create-thumbnails;
    create-thumbnails-->publish-source;
    create-thumbnails-->publish-thumbnails;
```

### [aws-list](https://github.com/linz/argo-tasks/blob/master/src/commands/list/list.ts)

Recursively loops through the provided source path and lists all the files within this location. Some listing parameters are currently hard-coded due to the current bespoke purpose of this workflow:

- group: `"2000"`
- include: `".*.*.tif?$"`

### [get-location](./standardising.yaml)

Finds the output location of this workflow within the artifacts bucket.

### [create-thumbnails](https://github.com/linz/topo-imagery/blob/master/scripts/thumbnails.py)

Runs the bespoke gdal_translate commands to generate thumbnails of the topo50 & topo250 Maps.
